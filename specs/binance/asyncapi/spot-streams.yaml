    AsyncAPI specification for Binance Spot WebSocket Streams (Market Data).

    This specification covers:
    1. Market Data Streams: Real-time spot market data without authentication
    2. User Data Streams: Real-time account and order updates via listenKey (authenticated; listenKey is obtained and kept alive via REST or WS-API)

    ## Connection Types

    ### Single Market Streams
    - Connection: Connect to `/ws/{streamName}` directly (or connect to `/ws` and SUBSCRIBE)
    - Data Format: Direct stream data (not wrapped)
    - Property: `combined = false`
    - Example: `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/btcusdt@aggTrade`

    ### Combined Market Streams (Multiple Streams)
    - Connection: Connect to `/stream?streams=<streamName1>/<streamName2>`
    - Data Format: Wrapped as `{"stream":"<streamName>","data":<rawPayload>}`
    - Property: `combined = true`
    - Max Streams: 1024 streams per connection
    - Example: `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/stream?streams=btcusdt@aggTrade/ethusdt@kline_1m`
    - Optional: Add `&timeUnit=MICROSECOND` for microsecond precision

    ### User Data Streams
    - Connection: Connect to `/ws/{listenKey}`
    - Data Format: Direct stream data for single listenKey; wrapped for multiple listenKeys
    - Authentication: Requires listenKey obtained via REST or WS-API
    - Example Single: `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/{listenKey}`

    ## Connection Management

    ### Initial Connection
    - Market Streams: Connect to `/ws/{streamName}` for single streams or `/stream` for combined streams
    - Use SUBSCRIBE method to add streams dynamically

    ### Heartbeat
    - Server sends ping periodically (about every 20s)
    - Client must respond with pong within 1 minute
    - Connection will be disconnected if no pong received

    ### Limits and Validity
    - Connection Validity: up to 24 hours
    - Rate Limit: 5 incoming messages per second
    - Streams per Connection: Maximum 1024 streams (market streams)
    - Connections per IP: Rate limiting applies

    ### Stream Naming Conventions
    - Symbols are lowercase (e.g., btcusdt)
    - Stream names are lowercase
    - Multiple streams can be combined in a single connection

    title: Single Market Streams Connection
    description: |
      Direct connection endpoint for individual market streams. Connect here to receive
      data from a specific stream. Each stream returns direct data. Alternatively, connect
      to `/ws` and use SUBSCRIBE to add streams dynamically.
      
      Optional time unit for timestamps can be specified as an additional query parameter
      on the URL: `&timeUnit=MICROSECOND`.

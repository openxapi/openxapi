    AsyncAPI specification for Binance USD-S Margined Futures WebSocket Streams (Market Data).
    
    This specification covers:
    1. Market Data Streams: Real-time futures market data without authentication
    
    ## Connection Types
    
    ### Single Market Streams
    - Connection: Connect to `/ws/{streamName}` directly (or `/ws` and SUBSCRIBE)
    - Data Format: Direct stream data (not wrapped)
    - Property: `combined = false`
    - Example: `wss://fstream.binance.com/ws/btcusdt@aggTrade`
    
    ### Combined Market Streams (Multiple Streams)
    - Connection: Connect to `/stream?streams=<streamName1>/<streamName2>`
    - Data Format: Wrapped as `{"stream":"<streamName>","data":<rawPayload>}`
    - Property: `combined = true`
    - Max Streams: 1024 streams per connection
    - Example: `wss://fstream.binance.com/stream?streams=btcusdt@aggTrade/ethusdt@kline_1m`

    ### User Data Streams (Account-Specific, Requires Authentication)
    - Connection: Connect to `/ws/{listenKey}`
    - Data Format: Direct stream data (not wrapped)
    - Listen Key: Obtained from REST API `userDataStream.start` request
    - Validity: 60 minutes, extendable with keepalives
    
    ## Connection Management
    
    ### Initial Connection
    - Market Streams: Connect to `/ws/{streamName}` for single streams or `/stream` for combined market streams
    - Use SUBSCRIBE method to add streams dynamically
    
    ### Heartbeat
    - Server sends ping periodically (about every 20s)
    - Client must respond with pong within 1 minute
    - Connection will be disconnected if no pong received
    
    ### Limits and Validity
    - Connection Validity: up to 24 hours
    - Rate Limit: 10 incoming messages per second
    - Streams per Connection: Maximum 1024 streams (market streams)
    - Connections per IP: Rate limiting applies
    
    ### Stream Naming Conventions
    - Symbols are lowercase (e.g., btcusdt)
    - Stream names are lowercase
    - Multiple streams can be combined in a single connection
    - Futures-specific streams include liquidation, mark price, index, etc.

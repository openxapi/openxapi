  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    AsyncAPI specification for Binance Options WebSocket Streams (Market Data and User Data).
    
    This specification covers both:
    1. **Market Data Streams**: Real-time options market data without authentication
    2. **User Data Streams**: Account and order updates requiring authentication via listenKey
    
    ## Connection Types
    
    ### Market Data Streams
    
    #### Single Streams
    - **Connection**: Connect to `/ws/<streamName>` directly
    - **Data Format**: Direct stream data (not wrapped)
    - **Property**: `combined = false`
    - **Example**: `wss://nbstream.binance.com/eoptions/ws/BTC-210630-9000-P@ticker`
    
    #### Combined Streams (Multiple Streams)  
    - **Connection**: Connect to `/stream?streams=<streamName1>/<streamName2>/<streamName3>`
    - **Data Format**: Wrapped as `{"stream":"<streamName>","data":<rawPayload>}`
    - **Property**: `combined = true`
    - **Max Streams**: 200 streams per connection
    - **Example**: `wss://nbstream.binance.com/eoptions/stream?streams=BTC-210630-9000-P@trade/BTC-210630-9000-P@ticker`
    
    ### User Data Streams
    
    - **Connection**: Connect to `/ws/<listenKey>`
    - **Authentication**: Requires valid listenKey obtained from REST API
    - **Data Format**: Direct event data for account updates, order updates, and risk level changes
    - **Example**: `wss://nbstream.binance.com/eoptions/ws/XaEAKTsQSRLZAGH9tuIu37plSRsdjmlAVBoNYPUITlTAko1WI22PgmBMpI1rS8Yh`
    
    ## Connection Management
    
    ### Initial Connection
    - Market Streams: Connect to `/ws/<streamName>` for single streams or `/stream` for combined streams
    - User Data Streams: Connect to `/ws/<listenKey>` with valid listenKey
    - Use SUBSCRIBE method to add streams dynamically (market streams only)
    
    ### Heartbeat
    - Server sends ping frame every 5 minutes
    - Client must respond with pong within 15 minutes
    - Connection will be disconnected if no pong received
    - Unsolicited pong frames are allowed
    
    ### Limits and Validity
    - **Connection Validity**: 24 hours maximum for market streams, 60 minutes for user data streams
    - **Rate Limit**: 10 incoming messages per second
    - **Streams per Connection**: Maximum 200 streams (market streams)
    - **Connections per IP**: Rate limiting applies
    - **IP Banning**: Repeated disconnections may result in IP ban
    - **ListenKey Validity**: 60 minutes, can be extended with userDataStream.ping
    
    ### Stream Naming Conventions
    - All symbols must be provided in UPPERCASE
    - All stream names are lowercase (except symbol parts)
    - Multiple streams can be combined in a single connection
    - Options use specific naming patterns (e.g., BTC-210630-9000-P, ETH-220930-1500-C)
    - ListenKey is a 64-character string obtained from REST API

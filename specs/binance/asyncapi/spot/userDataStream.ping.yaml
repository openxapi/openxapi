            Ping a user data stream to keep it alive.
            User data streams close automatically after 60 minutes,
            even if you're listening to them on WebSocket Streams.
            In order to keep the stream open, you have to regularly send pings using the userDataStream.ping request.
            It is recommended to send a ping once every 30 minutes.

            Get current order book.
            Note that this request returns limited market depth.
            If you need to continuously monitor order book updates, please consider using WebSocket Streams:
            - <symbol>@depth<levels>
            - <symbol>@depth
            You can use depth request together with <symbol>@depth streams to maintain a local order book.
